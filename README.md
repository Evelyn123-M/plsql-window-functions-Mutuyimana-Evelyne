Step 1: Problem Definition
Business Context

UrbanMart Ltd. is a retail company based in Kigali with branches across Rwanda. The company sells groceries, beverages, and household products.
Its sales department needs reliable data analysis to monitor sales performance and customer behavior across different regions (Kigali, Musanze, Huye, Rubavu).

Data Challenge

Even though UrbanMart records transactions, managers struggle to:
Identify the best-performing products in each region and time period.
Track sales growth trends from month to month.
Segment customers into groups based on spending power.
Without this insight, business decisions (e.g., promotions, stock management, and regional marketing) are based on guesswork instead of data.

Expected Outcome

Using PL/SQL window functions, UrbanMart aims to:
Identify top products per region and quarter.
Track running totals and sales trends.
Measure month-to-month growth in sales.
Segment customers into quartiles for marketing.
Provide clear, actionable insights to support stocking, promotions, and customer loyalty programs.
